    <h4> All about Minecraft</h4>
    <p> Minecraft is a game where you dig and build different kinds of 3D blocks within a large world of varying terrains and habitats to explore.

In this world the sun rises and sets as you go about your work, gathering materials and making tools. There is rain and the occasional lightning storm, and animals that you can tame, farm or use for food. Depending on which mode you’re playing in, you might also need to fight for your survival against hunger, danger and bad guys.</p>
    
    <h4> How do you play?</h4>
    <p> Minecraft is what’s called a sandbox game, where the player creates the game themselves by manipulating the world within it (like kids playing in the sand). There are no specific steps or goals, so everyone playing the game is having a different experience.</p>
